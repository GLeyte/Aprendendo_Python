As you begin working with files, you may find it helpful to be able to quickly see what the extension (.txt, .pdf, .jpg, and so on) of a file is. With macOS and Linux, your file browser most likely shows extensions automatically. With Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default. To show extensions, go to Start ▸ Control Panel ▸ Appearance and Personalization ▸ Folder Options. On the View tab, under Advanced Settings, uncheck the Hide extensions for known file types checkbox.
